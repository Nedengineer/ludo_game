# Ludo-Python-game-
Ludo is a strategy board game for two to four[a] players, in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish according to rolls of a single die.

I created this game back in 2016 during my third semester for my Computational Thinking 2 course. I created the game in Python using it's tkinter graphics library.

Compile the Ludo-game.py file to play.

INSTRUCTIONS

•	Unless you get a '6' when rolling the dice, your planes can't take off
•	Press the ROLL button to roll the dice.
•	If it is a 6, then you can take another turn. So press ROLL again.
•	Click the plane which you want to move the first ROLL. The plane will move itself according to the number of the dice.
•	If the plane lands on stop, it cannot be killed.
•	To kill another color’s plane, you have to make your plane land on that box where other colored plane is.
•	If there are two planes of the same color on top of each other than that plane cannot be killed.
•	To win the game, your planes have to traverse around the board and come into the home lane.
•	If a player gets 3 six’s in a row, than his/her turn is void and next players plays.
